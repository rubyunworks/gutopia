= GUtopIa - A Ruby GUI Meta-API

GUtopIa is an ultra-high level GUI API that sits on
top of a variety of other backends (Qt, GTK, Cocoa, etc.)

The most significant issue that arises in trying to create
a high level API the caters to a wide variety of backend
systems is the LCD problem --Least Common Denominator.
Because each backend system has it's own specific design
and features it is not possible to support each backend
in full since the "meta-API" can only support the features
that all backends have in common. GUtopIa mitigates this
issue by being an *ultra*-high level library. By building
an API that focuses on very high level structures, each
underlying backend is given room to implement those
features in the way that best suites it strengths.

That is concept in anycase. GUtopIa's overall design is
still being developed and very little implementation has
yet to take shape.

Take a look at the demo/ directory to get a understanding
of the current API concepts.
